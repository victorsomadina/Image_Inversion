# Image Inversion Program

Nothing much, this is just a program that collects or reads user input of an image file, inverts the image, and saves the image to a file path specified by the user also. 

**Check the Python .ipynb code file** 
### For example: 
I have this heart image below.

And after I run the program on the image above, we have something like this below

The purpose of this project is to test my Python skills of creating class objects to solve a specific problem.
