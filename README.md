# Image_Inversion Program

Nothing much, this is just a program that collects or reads user input of an image file, inverts the image, and saves the image to a file path specified by the user also. 
### For example: 
I have this heart image below.

[C:\Users\hp\Pictures\heart2.png]

And after I run the program on the image above, we have something like this below

C:\Users\hp\Downloads\Inverted_image (1).jpg

The purpose of this project is to test my Python skills of creating class objects to solve a specific problem.
